                <p class="mainTextLeft">Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that
                    is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a
                    wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other
                    desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.<br>

                    The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a
                    liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients
                    and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla,
                    with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit
                    preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and
                    decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.<br>

                    Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries,
                    and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate,
                    and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time
                    considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment
                    and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.<br></p>
